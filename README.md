# Multiclass Brain Segmentation
My code snippets from the UNET based multiclass brain segmentation model made for the <a href="https://feta-2021.grand-challenge.org/">Fetal Brain Tissue Annotation and Segmentation Challenge (FeTA), MICCAI 2021</a>.

As the challenge is still ongoing the repository has only less "custom made" elements like data loader or the training script.
